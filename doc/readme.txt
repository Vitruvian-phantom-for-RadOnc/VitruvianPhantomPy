The folder contains

The theoretical GT values as generated by the MATLAB code (reformatted in excel format for clarity) for the dataset published as:

Boukerroui, Djamal; Gooding, Mark (2022), “The Vitruvian Man Dataset of Analytic calculations and synthetic shapes for validation of quantitative contour comparison software”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/9xjyrftzth.1

It also contains a copy of the:
	1- generated Json files, used as input to generate the dataset. These describe the correspondence between the structure names as stored in the RTSS files and the shape geometries. 
	2- all the empirical estimations (the csv files in the results directory) but compiled in three excel files.
